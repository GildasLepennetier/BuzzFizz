# BuzzFizz

The FizzBuzz game is quite easy to understand:
We replace numbers that can be divided by 3 by Fizz and by 5 by Buzz.
If the number can be divided by both, then it should be FizzBuzz.

(Several solutions exists already)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-implementations-of-the-fizzbuzz-problem-using-r-language/]
and this repository is yet just another example, using a hardocded version (very fast) but I also propose another general version
